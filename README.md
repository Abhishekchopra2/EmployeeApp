# EmployeeApp

Two tabs are there:
 - Employee List 
 - Employee Dashboard
 
Employee List: Here I have used Webix ui data table and fetching data from web api. Here I can also perform add, edit, delete.
Sorting and filtering are still happening at client side, not able to find server side implementation with webix ui data table.

Employee Dashboard: Here I have used ng2-charts and chart.js for creating charts. I have added bar chart and doughnut chart and fetching data from web api.

Web APIs: Here I have created multiple APIs using ASP.NET Web API. I have SQL server to create database and used entity framework database first approach to communicate with database. I have also used ninject so that code is not dependant on interface instead of concrete class directly.
